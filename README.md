Quran Images
============

This project contains tools to convert images of the Holy Quran pages from
[King Fahd Glorious Quran Printing Complex](http://www.qurancomplex.org/) to
a format that I would like to use. In this case, from a full page in Adobe
Illustrator's format to a cropped page version in SVG and PNG formats.
